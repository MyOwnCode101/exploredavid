          <p>A detailed breakdown of the processes, technologies, and tools that powered the development and realization of the ExploreDavid project.</p>

        <h2>Web Structure and Deployment</h2>
        <p>The website was developed using standard front-end technologies: HTML for markup, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactive behavior. The design approach focused on clarity, responsiveness, and cross-device compatibility. All files were manually organized and deployed to a static hosting environment, making the experience accessible to users without the need for server-side processing.</p>
        <p>Each section of the website corresponds to a stage in the project, with pages dynamically embedded and linked to form a coherent narrative. The site was tested across multiple browsers and screen sizes to ensure optimal performance and reliability.</p>

        <h2>3D Model Preparation and Optimization</h2>
        <p>The digital model of Michelangelo’s <em>David</em> was optimized using Bambu Studio, a slicer application developed for Bambu Lab 3D printers. The model underwent mesh analysis and segmentation to reduce overhangs and improve print stability. The statue was scaled and oriented to fit the constraints of our printing setup without compromising anatomical fidelity.</p>
        <p>Given the printer’s vertical limitations, the model was divided into two precise halves to be printed independently. Support structures and adhesion strategies were defined to maintain dimensional accuracy throughout the print job.</p>

        <h2>Printing with Bambu Lab A1 Mini</h2>
        <p>The physical fabrication process was executed on a Bambu Lab A1 Mini — a compact, high-resolution FDM 3D printer. With a maximum print height of 18 cm, each half of the statue was printed sequentially over a cumulative period of approximately 26 hours. PLA filament was used for its print consistency, ease of finishing, and durability.</p>
        <p>After printing, both halves were aligned, bonded using high-strength adhesive, and post-processed to conceal the seam. Final surface finishing included light sanding and detail cleanup to enhance the statue’s continuity and aesthetic appeal.</p>

        <h2>Integration of the Digital Model</h2>
        <p>To provide an interactive online viewing experience, the optimized 3D model was uploaded to Sketchfab, a cloud-based platform supporting real-time rendering of complex geometry. Model parameters including lighting, material properties, camera angles, and background were configured to match the tone and clarity intended for web audiences.</p>
        <p>The Sketchfab embed was integrated directly into the site using an iframe, ensuring compatibility across devices and browsers. Responsive layout techniques ensured the viewer scaled naturally with screen resolution, maintaining full interactivity across platforms.</p>

        <h2>End-to-End Workflow</h2>
        <p>ExploreDavid is a complete loop from physical to digital and back. The project merges physical craftsmanship with web deployment, 3D printing with model visualization, and educational value with modern presentation standards. Each element — from slicing and print tuning to responsive HTML layout and embedded rendering — was implemented directly by the project team without the use of third-party automation tools or external developers.</p>
        <p>This page serves as a transparent explanation of the engineering and design principles that shaped ExploreDavid, and is intended to offer insight into the technical considerations behind art–technology integration.</p>
