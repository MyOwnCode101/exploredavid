									<h1>3D Deployment &<br />Creative Execution</h1>
									<p>A detailed look into the artistic and structural work behind ExploreDavid.com</p>
								</header>

								<p>Daniele Pio Pica was responsible for the physical execution and presentation refinement of the ExploreDavid.com project. His work ensured that the final visual and material aspects of the project accurately reflected the craftsmanship and aesthetic quality of the original David sculpture.</p>

								<p>Daniele led the planning and execution of the 3D printing process, beginning with careful evaluation of the model’s geometry to determine the optimal orientation for print stability and resolution. He manually sliced the model using Bambu Studio, making critical adjustments to infill, wall thickness, and layer height to balance structural strength and fidelity. Recognizing the height limitations of the 3D printer, he precisely divided the statue into two symmetrical 17.2 cm segments, totaling 34.4 cm once assembled.</p>

								<p>Each part of the sculpture was printed independently with meticulous calibration of nozzle temperature, bed adhesion, and cooling settings. Daniele oversaw the continuous monitoring of the print process to prevent warping, layer shifts, or support failures. Post-processing involved careful removal of supports, surface smoothing, and fitting alignment for a clean, seamless assembly. The pieces were joined using industrial-grade adhesive, with clamps and guides to ensure vertical precision.</p>

								<p>Beyond fabrication, Daniele designed the visual brand identity for ExploreDavid.com, including the logo, color palette, and layout concept. His minimalist, elegant approach ensured that the visual tone of the site reflected the classical sophistication of Michelangelo’s work. He also coordinated the on-site documentation and photoshoots, managing light setup, backdrop control, and editing to visually showcase the model's anatomical features in detail.</p>

								<p>Additionally, Daniele contributed to the written and verbal presentation of the project, ensuring that technical explanations were accessible and aligned with the artistic narrative. His role bridged the gap between material craft and conceptual clarity, giving ExploreDavid.com not only its form, but its soul.</p>

								<p>In every step—from slicing to branding—Daniele’s eye for balance, proportion, and presentation ensured that the project stood not just as a technical product, but as a respectful homage to Renaissance mastery through contemporary means.</p>
