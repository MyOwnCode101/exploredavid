          <h1>Prototyping the<br />
          3D Experience</h1>
          <p>Before launching the final product, we ran experiments and tests to find the best way to bring David into an immersive digital format.</p>
        </header>

        <p>The prototyping phase was where the project took shape — literally. We began by experimenting with how the 3D model would look and feel inside the browser. Since the goal was full interactivity, we evaluated different viewer options that could handle complex geometry while remaining lightweight and responsive.</p>

        <p>After testing options like Three.js and <code>&lt;model-viewer&gt;</code>, we discovered that **Sketchfab** offered the best combination of visual quality, simplicity, and accessibility. Its built-in controls for rotation, zooming, lighting, and environment made it ideal for our educational and aesthetic goals.</p>

        <p>Once the viewer was embedded, we focused on testing user experience: could someone on a phone or laptop easily explore David without lag? Could the lighting and background be adjusted to reflect the artistic tone of the project? This led us to tweak the Sketchfab embed settings, such as default camera position and lighting presets, to make the model feel more natural and impressive.</p>

        <p>We also created multiple layout drafts for the website, testing different image placements, text hierarchies, and section structures until we landed on a format that felt clean and respectful of the artwork while still inviting digital interaction.</p>

        <p>Through trial, error, and iteration, this phase laid the foundation for the final experience: elegant, accessible, and technically solid — ready to be shared with the world.</p>
