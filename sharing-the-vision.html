          <h1>Sharing<br />The Vision</h1>
          <p>This wasn’t just a school project. It was a message: that culture belongs to everyone, and technology can help make it happen.</p>
        </header>

        <p>We didn't build this experience to keep it to ourselves. From the very beginning, we imagined a way for *David* to reach new eyes, new places, and new people. That’s why we shared the final version publicly — both through our website and platforms like Sketchfab.</p>

        <p>By embedding the model on our site and uploading it to an open 3D library, we made it easy for anyone to explore the sculpture. Students, teachers, art lovers, and the simply curious could rotate, zoom, and view every detail, no matter where they were. It was culture without walls.</p>

        <p>And while we’re proud of the tech, the design, and the execution — what really matters to us is the feeling it gives people. Curiosity. Wonder. A little bit of awe. If we’ve made even one person stop and say, “Whoa, I didn’t know I could see this like that,” then it was worth every line of code and every hour of work.</p>

        <p>Sharing the vision means more than publishing a site. It means believing in open access, in the value of history, and in the creative potential of anyone who dares to combine the two. And that’s exactly what we set out to do.</p>
