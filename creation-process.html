          <h1>Mapping the<br />
          Creation Process</h1>
          <p>Every project starts with a vision — here’s how we brought ours to life step by step, from concept to creation.</p>

        <p>The journey began with an idea: to reimagine Michelangelo’s *David* in a format that anyone could interact with digitally. We knew that to succeed, we needed both a physical model and a fully functional web experience — and a strong synergy between design, tech, and storytelling.</p>

        <p>We first sourced a high-resolution 3D model of *David* and began optimizing it using slicing and modeling software. Careful attention was given to mesh integrity and detail preservation, especially since the model would later be printed using a Bambu Lab 3D printer. This required balancing polygon count with accuracy to ensure that the final physical version honored the sculpture’s anatomical precision.</p>

        <p>Simultaneously, we mapped out the visual and structural identity of the website. Inspired by clean design systems and digital galleries, we selected the Massively HTML5 UP template and modified it to match our project’s atmosphere — a blend of classic grandeur and modern interactivity.</p>

        <p>Once the model was printed and reviewed, we shifted focus to the interactive part: allowing users to explore David directly in the browser. Instead of complex 3D libraries or custom WebGL code, we chose to embed the model using Sketchfab, which allowed for smooth rotation, zoom, and real-time interaction — all without requiring users to install anything. This approach made the experience accessible and visually polished across all devices.</p>

        <p>The final steps involved integrating all assets, testing the site across browsers and screen sizes, and deploying it publicly. We also uploaded the model to Sketchfab to extend accessibility and make sure the sculpture was viewable even outside the website.</p>

        <p>Each phase brought its own challenges, but also deeper understanding. What started as a school task became a collaborative experience of learning, creativity, and respect for digital craftsmanship.</p>
